  "original_story": "Aboard the cursed ship The Sea Serpent, Captain Redbeard peered into the abyss, where the ocean floor cradled a glowing artifact of unknown origin. As the ship rocked atop the waves, he hauled it aboard, sensing the tide of fate shift. From the deep, monstrous shapes surgedâ€”leviathans with fangs like anchors. Redbeard stood firm, the artifact blazing in his grip as he battled the beasts. When the sea fell still, the relic rose, casting a vision across the sky: an ancient prophecy long forgotten. As its light danced across the waves, Redbeard knew the sea had chosen its next legend.",
