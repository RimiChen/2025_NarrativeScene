  "original_story": "In the rain-slicked alleys of Zephyr, streetwise Jax knelt by a loose cobblestone glowing faintly beneath the streetlight’s shimmer. Beneath it, he uncovered an emerald amulet pulsing with forgotten energy. Clutching it in his hand, a surge of ancient power surged through him, surrounding him in a halo of green fire. The city trembled. Above the skyline, a sinister sorcerer descended from the clouds. Jax stood his ground, the amulet blazing with newfound strength. Magic clashed in the sky, old and new. When the light faded, only Jax remained—victorious and forever changed by the artifact he had unearthed from the street.",
