  "original_story": "In the blistering Sahara Desert, where the sun beats down on endless dunes, Dr. Samuel Cross knelt near an unearthed ancient amulet glinting in the sand. The Sahara Desert contained more than secrets—it held the path to legend. As he journeyed onward, a violent sandstorm engulfed Cross, tearing visibility to shreds. Through the storm, he read cryptic hieroglyphs etched in stone, while tomb raiders pursued him relentlessly. Deeper inside the pyramid, Cross stood in a hidden chamber—an elaborate pyramid trap that contained deadly mechanisms. Clutching the fabled treasure, Cross narrowly escaped, leaving behind danger but carrying history in his hands.",
